Certainly, here is the README.md file again for your car price prediction project.

Used Car Price Prediction App
This project is a Streamlit web application that predicts the price of a used car based on its features. It utilizes a machine learning pipeline built with scikit-learn to handle data preprocessing and modeling.

Features
Interactive UI: A user-friendly interface to input car features such as mileage, year, make, and model.

Real-time Prediction: Get an instant price prediction as you adjust the input values.

Stratified Data Splitting: The underlying model is trained on data split using stratification to ensure an even representation of car makes and models, leading to more accurate predictions.

Automated Preprocessing: The scikit-learn pipeline automatically handles one-hot encoding for categorical features.

How It Works
The application uses a GradientBoostingRegressor model to predict the car's price. The entire machine learning workflow is encapsulated in a scikit-learn Pipeline, which performs two main steps:

Preprocessing: A ColumnTransformer applies OneHotEncoder to categorical features (make and model), transforming them into a numerical format. Other features like mileage and year are passed through without modification.

Regression: The preprocessed data is then fed to the GradientBoostingRegressor for training and prediction.

This pipeline ensures that the data is prepared correctly and consistently for both training the model and making new predictions.

How to Run
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher

Streamlit

Pandas

Scikit-learn

NumPy

You can install these dependencies using pip:

Bash

pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn numpy
Execution
Ensure the ca-dealers-used.csv file is in the data directory relative to your script, or update the file path in the Python code.

Save the Python code provided in the previous response as a Python file (e.g., app.py).

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved app.py, and run the following command:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
The application will open in your default web browser.
